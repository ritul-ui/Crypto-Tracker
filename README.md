The goal of this project is to develop a cryptocurrency tracker web application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Chart.js.
The application will display the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, and provide detailed information and historical price charts for each cryptocurrency. On the home page when a user clicks the name of a crypto coin, a new page should open about that particular coin. In this page we will have the details of the coin and a chart which will depict price variation of the coin in last 24 hr, in last 30 days and in last 3 months.

In this project, I have implemented Debouncing, Sorting, Searching, ChartJS, pagination in js to show 25 records per page.
